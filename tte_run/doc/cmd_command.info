Running Testing Environment Batch Test
For certification activities, you run tests in batch as described below. Before running any
tests on host, you must verify the Testing Environment integrity as detailed in “Verifying
Testing Environment Installation Integrity” on page 192.

To run model test in batch
Use the following command line syntax and options:
Note
When running model tests, Testing Environment batch automatically checks test data (in STP
file) for the proper initialization of all sensors and inputs of the tested operator. Any
initialization failure is reported as a warning and does not prevent code execution.
QTE -tee -conf <configuration>
-test_file <stp file>
-target_dir <dir>
[-tee:real_digits <value> ]
[-tee:nobuild]
[-report:details <full | failed>]
<project>

Possible command options and parameters:
• -tee: to launch TEE on specified project with specified options described below
• -conf <configuration>: to specify the name of the configuration used to build the model
executable with TEE specific settings
• -test_file <stp file>: to specify the path to the STP file containing test data descriptions
required by TEE (see “Producing Test Data for Testing Environment Batch” on page 186)
• -target_dir <dir>: to specify the name of the directory for test execution output files
• -tee:real_digits: to set the precision (max. number of displayed digits) of real numbers logged
in simulation trace file. <value> must be an integer between 1 and 17 included (default is 5).
• -tee:nobuild: to skip code generation and build phases and use an existing model executable
• -report:details <full | failed>: to produce a conformance report with all test result details
or only result details about failed tests (see “Reading Test Conformance Reports” on page 177)
• <project>: to specify the name of (or path to) the ETP project to be tested

Running MTC-Model Merge

Use the following command to merge coverage results from several acquisition sessions on the same model (without using the instrumented project) and produce a merged coverage
report and all required logs:

SCADE –MTC_MERGE|-mtc_merge <Project>
-cov_files <CoverageFile1.crf> <CoverageFile2.crf> ...
[-justif_files <JustifFile1.txt> <JustifFile2.txt> ...]
[-target_dir <Directory>]
[-author <Author>]
[-result_project <MTCResultProject>]
[-help | -version

Possible command options and parameters:
• –MTC_MERGE|-mtc_merge to launch MTC-Model batch merge on the specified project
• <Project> to specify the pathname of the SCADE Suite model (not instrumented) to use to merge
coverage results. If you merge results from different projects, it is necessary to specify a global
project that references all the other projects.
• -cov_files <CoverageFile1.crf> <CoverageFile2.crf> to specify the path to each coverage
result file to merge (all corresponding CDF files are necessary to check criteria and results)
• -justif_files <JustifFile1.txt> <JustifFile2.txt> (optional) to specify the path to each
text file (containing justifications to consolidate coverage when needed) to merge with coverage
results
• -target_dir <Directory> (optional) to specify the directory where the output files are stored.
By default, a generation directory named MTC_<project_name>_merged is created in the same
directory as <Project>.
• -author <Author> (optional) to specify the author of the batch merge session
• -result_project <MTC Result Project> (optional) to specify the creation of a result project
containing all coverage result files of the current acquisition. The project is generated in the
working directory. If the result project already exists, the coverage files are added to it. This
result project is not part of the qualified data of MTC, but enables the display of results in MTC
user interface.

INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES
The justification files can be written manually in the required syntax or exported from model. For details about the syntax of textual justifications, see “Input Justification File for
MTC-Model” on page 214 in SCADE Suite Technical Manual. For details about textual justification export, see “Covering Coverage Cases by Justification” on page 763.

Note
For more details about MTC-Model batch merge for certification, consult the Tool Operational Requirements of SCADE Suite MTC-Part II (TOR) distributed with the Qualified MTC
certification data available from Esterel Technologies Support service.

The coverage result file (CRF) and the criteria definition file (CDF) produced in batch merge are stored and named as follows:
<TargetDir>\<project_name>_merged.crf
<TargetDir>\<project_name>_merged.cdf

The coverage result file contains the following elements:
• All merged coverage records from coverage files set in the command line.
• All justification records from textual justification files set in the command line.

The coverage report produced in batch merge is stored and named as follows:
<TargetDir>\MTC_<project_name>_merged.txt

The structure of the merge coverage report is the following:
1 General information about the batch session and its parameters
2 Input description providing details about the project, the predefined coverage and integration criteria, the user criteria (if any), and the scenario/justification records.
3 Coverage information providing: synthesis about overall coverage with some details by operators and records.

The logs produced in batch merge are stored and named as follows:
<TargetDir>\MTC_<project_name>_merged.log

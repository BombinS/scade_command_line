Producing Consolidated Test Reports in Batch

Whenever launching test execution on models, the test conformance report is automated and produced from the raw result files generated by TEE. 
You have the possibility to consolidate test reports with different detail levels from a selection of raw result files resulting from previous unitary test sessions.
For certification activities, you launch test report consolidation in batch as described below.

To launch consolidated report generation in batch
Use the following command line syntax and options:

QTEREPORT -out <file>
files ...
[ -files <file> ]
[ -details <full | failed> ]
[ -author <name> ]

Possible command options and parameters:
• -out: to specify the location and name of the consolidated test report file
• files: to list the raw result files resulting from other test sessions with TEE
• -files: to specify a file where all raw result files are listed (one file path per line)
• -details <full | failed>: to produce a consolidated report with all test result details or only
result details about failed tests
• -author: to name the author of the report
